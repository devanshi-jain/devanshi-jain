# Hello there, I'm Devanshi! 
I'm a senior at UC San Diego, pursuing a Math-CS major with a passion for software development and research. 
- :star2: As a Software Intern at <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/derconnect/home?authuser=0">Jacobs School of Engineering</a>, I actively contribute to projects aimed at optimizing smart plug usage. This involves developing scheduler grader programs, generating heatmaps, and calculating efficiency metrics to maximize energy savings.
